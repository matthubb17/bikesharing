# Bikesharing

## Project Overview:

The goal of this project was to use tableau to create an analysis of NYC CitiBike bikesharing data from August 2019. This analysis will be used to help determine if it makes sense to start a ridesharing bike program in Des Moines, Iowa.

## Resources:

**Main Challenge File:** [CitiBike Challenge](https://github.com/matthubb17/bikesharing/blob/main/NYC_CitiBike_Challenge.ipynb)

**Software:** Python, Jupyter Notebook, Tableau Public

The above map shows you where rental bike trips started. The size of the circles and darkness will help the viewer to better identify where the most popular areas trips started were. You can see that the most common start area for a rental was in Manhattan.

Similar to the starting map, the map above shows the same data for the ending locations for the rentals. Manhattan is the most popular ending location as well.

This heatmap helps to identify what times users are renting the bikes most frequently. As you can see, usage is spread out throughout most of the day. The times that bikes are least used are in the early mornings and late at night when most people are sleeping.

![Image 7](https://github.com/matthubb17/bikesharing/blob/main/Images/Trips%20by%20Gender%20(Weekday%20per%20Hour).png)

This heatma shows the number of bike trips by gender for each hour of each day of the week, and the heatmap can be filtered by gender. From this we can see that men are the primary renters.

![Image 8](https://github.com/matthubb17/bikesharing/blob/main/Images/User%20Trips%20by%20Gender%20by%20Weekday.png)

This heatmap was created to show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week, and you can filter by both user and gender.
