# Bikesharing

## Project Overview:

The goal of this project was to use tableau to create an analysis of NYC CitiBike bikesharing data from August 2019. This analysis will be used to help determine if it makes sense to start a ridesharing bike program in Des Moines, Iowa.

## Resources:

**Main Challenge File:** [CitiBike Challenge](https://github.com/matthubb17/bikesharing/blob/main/NYC_CitiBike_Challenge.ipynb)

**Software:** Python, Jupyter Notebook, Tableau Public

## Results:

Below is a link to the dashbaord that was created:

The above image helps the viewer to better understand the demographics of the users of CitiBikes. You can see the total number of rides in the given time period along with a gender breakdown and a subscriber/customer breakdown.

The above map shows you where rental bike trips started. The size of the circles and darkness will help the viewer to better identify where the most popular areas trips started were. You can see that the most common start area for a rental was in Manhattan.

Similar to the starting map, the map above shows the same data for the ending locations for the rentals. Manhattan is the most popular ending location as well.

The above graph shows the number of trips by duration. It helps the viewer to see that the majority of trips that are taken typically are less than 1 hour.

![Image 5](https://github.com/matthubb17/bikesharing/blob/main/Images/Checkout%20Times%20by%20Gender.png)

This graph shows the nummber of trips by duration, seperated by gender. As you can see, Males are taking a majority of the rides.

![Image 6](https://github.com/matthubb17/bikesharing/blob/main/Images/Trips%20by%20Weekday%20per%20Hour.png)

This heatmap helps to identify what times users are renting the bikes most frequently. As you can see, usage is spread out throughout most of the day. The times that bikes are least used are in the early mornings and late at night when most people are sleeping.
***

![Image 7](https://github.com/matthubb17/bikesharing/blob/main/Images/Trips%20by%20Gender%20(Weekday%20per%20Hour).png)

This heatma shows the number of bike trips by gender for each hour of each day of the week, and the heatmap can be filtered by gender. From this we can see that men are the primary renters.
***

![Image 8](https://github.com/matthubb17/bikesharing/blob/main/Images/User%20Trips%20by%20Gender%20by%20Weekday.png)

This heatmap was created to show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week, and you can filter by both user and gender.


## Summary:

From the analysis above we see that the most popular location for renting bikes is in the Manhattan area. In addition, males are by far more common to rent during both rush hour times most likely in an effort to avoid traffic.

Additional Analysis Ideas:

  - I would like to take a look at other years of data to get a better idea of if trends have changed. This could be perticularily interesting to see the impact of COVID-19 on the data
  - One other thing that I would like to explore would be to see if these trends are common in other cities. Sice the goal of this project was to determine if it makes sense to start a program in Des Moines, Iowa.
